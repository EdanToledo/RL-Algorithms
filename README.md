# RL Algorithms
Jupyter Notebooks of minimal Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

I'll be continuing this as time permits. I'll try comment as much as possible and give small explanations in the beginning of each algorithm. 

# Current Algorithms
- REINFORCE
- DQN & DDQN - only real change is target update
- One Step Actor-Critic
- DDPG
